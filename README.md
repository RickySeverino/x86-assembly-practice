# x86 Assembly Practice #

This is a repo with my asm files I made for practicing x86 Assembly

### Compile/Run ###

To compile the program, make sure 'Makefile' is in the same directory as the file.

The following will will compile the code

```
make all

```
Print the shellcode with

```
make raw

```
To remove the object file as well as the output file (everything but the asm file), run the command

```
make clean

```
